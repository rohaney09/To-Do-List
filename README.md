# To-Do-List
This "To-Do List" web application is a simple yet functional tool for managing tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The application consists of:

HTML: Provides the structure, including an input field for new tasks, a submit button, and an unordered list to display tasks.
CSS: Styles the application, making it visually appealing with responsive design, intuitive layout, and clear task delineation.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, enabling task addition, completion, and deletion. It uses event listeners to handle form submission and button clicks, dynamically updating the task list.
This setup makes the To-Do List a practical example of a front-end web application that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly experience.
